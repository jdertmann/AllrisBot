# Allris Bot

A Telegram bot that notifies users about newly published documents in local council information systems powered by **Allris 4** and the **OParl API**. This bot was originally developed for the city of Bonnâ€™s council information system, but should work with any Allris 4 instance or, with slight modifications, even other systems that implement the OParl standard.


Currently running as [@AllrisBot](https://t.me/AllrisBot) for Bonn.
